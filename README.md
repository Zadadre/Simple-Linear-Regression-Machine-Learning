# Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Project ðŸ¤–

## About
The Simple Linear Regression Machine Learning Project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict salaries based on years of experience. The dataset used for this project is called `Salary_Data`, which consists of two columns: "Years of Experience" and "Salary".

## Dataset Overview
- **Dataset:** `Salary_Data`
- **Columns:** 
  - Years of Experience
  - Salary
- **Objective:** Predict the salary of individuals based on their years of experience.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration:** Explore the dataset to understand the relationship between years of experience and salary.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Check for missing values, outliers, and perform any necessary data transformations.
3. **Model Building:** Use Simple Linear Regression to build the predictive model.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
5. **Prediction:** Make predictions on new data to estimate salaries based on years of experience.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Zadadre/Simple-Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning.git`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) to view the project.

## Usage
1. Run each cell in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code.
2. Follow the comments and instructions provided in the notebook for guidance.
3. Explore the predictions and model performance metrics.
